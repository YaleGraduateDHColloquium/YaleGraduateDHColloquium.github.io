Do you work with historical images? Would you like to learn new ways of analyzing your sources?

This talk discussed the development of Photogrammar, a digital public humanities project facilitating analysis of documentary photography. It addressed how the project started during graduate work at Yale and changed over time. Along the way, issues of institutions, labor, credit and mentorship as well as the shifting landscape of Digital Humanities since 2010 were discussed.
