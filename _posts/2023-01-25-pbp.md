This talk discussed the Paris Bible Project, a transnational digital humanities project aiming to understand the production and diffusion of Latin Bibles in medieval Europe. 

Using emerging and established techniques in digital research in the humanities, the project challenges the received opinion of Paris Bibles as uniform, even though it was a model that was created with a degree of standardization and spread in Europe in the 13th century. 

The project uses handwritten text recognition (HTR) to create diplomatic transcriptions from digitized copies of manuscripts and we study the spelling and abbreviation of words in the transcriptions as distinctive features for understanding more about the specificities of the manuscript, for example, scribal habits, localization or dating.

The talk focused on the digital methods and tools used in the project.
