**Do you have several versions of a text that you need to collate or align? Do you want to better understand the genetic relationship between these texts by making a stemma? Alternatively, do you simply want to build familiarity with Python and other DH (Digital Humanities) tools?**

Many literary and textual scholars must confront the issue that multiple versions of the “same” text often survive, whether in epigraphic, manuscript, or printed form. However, the number of copies or the differences between them can quickly become overwhelming. Fortunately, computers are here to help!
 
Over the course of two 50-minute sessions, attendees learned how to use the CollateX package for Python, a powerful tool for text alignment, collation and visualization. They used Jupyter Notebook to practice coding and then write Python scripts to run from the command line. You were also introduced to the online stemmatics platform StemmaWeb, which can handle the output of CollateX.

**When:** Wednesday, February 22, 2023 at 4pm  
**Where:** Yale Humanities Quadrangle 107

<br>

## Additional Information:
**Recommended to bring:**
1. Laptop with up-to-date Windows or Macintosh operating system
2. Very basic familiarity with Python (a popular coding language for DH)
3. Transcriptions (as .txt files) of 3+ versions of a text that you would like to align; otherwise, I will supply sample text.
Note: 500 to 1000 words of text is a good size, but more or less is okay. Removing "accidentals", or non-important variation such as punctuation, is recommended.
4. Have access to a plain text editor such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)  

**Before the workshop:**
Install the Anaconda Python distribution (bundled with Jupyter Notebook, Powershell for Windows, etc.): https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
