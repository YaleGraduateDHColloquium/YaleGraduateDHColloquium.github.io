**Do you work with handwritten or printed texts? Do you need to transcribe them? Would you like to learn how to do so automatically thanks to Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR)?**

This workshop discussed how to train a custom Artifical Intelligence (AI) model to recognize and transcribe automatically handwritten and printed texts. Participants learnt to use the platform Transkribus and how to apply Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) techniques to their own research.
