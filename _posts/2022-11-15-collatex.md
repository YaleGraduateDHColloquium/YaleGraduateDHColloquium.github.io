<br>

**Do you work with multiple versions of the "same" text? Do you have transcriptions that you need to collate or align? Or do you simply want to build familiarity with Python and other DH (Digital Humanities) tools?**

Over the course of two 50-minute sessions, participants learnt how to use the CollateX package for Python, a powerful tool for text alignment, collation and visualization. We used Jupyter Notebook for practice and then wrote Python scripts to run from the command line.

<br>

**When:** Tuesday, November 15, 2022 at 4.30pm  
**Where:** Yale Humanities Quadrangle 129

<br>

## Additional Information:
**Recommended to bring:**
1. Laptop with up-to-date Windows or Macintosh operating system
2. Very basic familiarity with Python (a popular coding language for DH)
3. Transcriptions of 3+ versions of a text that you would like to collate as plain text (.txt) files; otherwise, I will supply sample text (Note: 500 to 1000 words of text is good, but more or less is okay. Removing "accidentals", or non-important variation such as punctuation, is recommended.)
4. Have access to a plain text editor such as Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)  

**Before the workshop:**
Install the Anaconda Python distribution (bundled with Jupyter Notebook, Powershell for Windows, etc.): https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
