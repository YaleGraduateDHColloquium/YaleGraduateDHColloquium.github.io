The Yale Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium was founded in September 2022 by Estelle Guéville, Kim Lifton and Serena Strecker. It brings together graduate students across disciplines to explore how digital tools can offer new possibilities in humanistic inquiry. Meetings of the Colloquium include informal brainstorming/troubleshooting sessions and presentations of both works-in-progress and established projects by Yale graduate students and faculty as well as guest speakers.

Estelle is a French curator and researcher currently pursuing her PhD in Medieval Studies at Yale. She previously worked for cultural institutions in France and the Gulf, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi where she was responsible for the medieval and islamic collection and developed digital research. She participates in several DH projects and is the co-creator of the [Paris Bible Project](https://parisbible.github.io/), a digital humanities initiative studying abbreviations and special letter forms as markers of scribal practices. In her dissertation, she aims to recover the history of medieval female scribes, using both traditional and digital methods of history and art history. At Yale, she co-created the Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium, a working group bringing together graduate students across disciplines.

Serena Strecker is a Ph.D. student in History at Yale University working on religious communication in late medieval and early modern Europe. Her dissertation explores the development of medieval sermon exempla into the early modern period. Since her introduction to digital tools at a paleography course in Göttingen last summer, she has sought to integrate methodologies from the digital humanities into her work. Together with Kim Lifton, she is working on building a model to transcribe sixteenth- and seventeenth-century exempla collections using Transkribus.
