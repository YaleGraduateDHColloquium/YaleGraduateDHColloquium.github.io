The Yale Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium was founded in September 2022 by Estelle Guéville, Kim Lifton and Serena Strecker. It brings together graduate students across disciplines to explore how digital tools can offer new possibilities in humanistic inquiry. Meetings of the Colloquium include informal brainstorming/troubleshooting sessions and presentations of both works-in-progress and established projects by Yale graduate students and faculty as well as guest speakers.
