The Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium brings together graduate students across disciplines to explore how digital tools can offer new possibilities in humanistic inquiry. Meetings of the Colloquium include informal brainstorming/troubleshooting sessions and presentations of both works-in-progress and established projects by Yale graduate students and faculty as well as guest speakers.
